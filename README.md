### Hey I'm Alex. I graduated from the Bloom Institute of Technology for data science, and am currently working on my knowledge of data structures & algorithms to become a better programmer. I'm actively applying for a Python software development or data analyst role, preferably on an agile team that's building innovative tools. 

Here's some of my recent projects:

â€¢ Built stock screening tools & a program to place paper trades based on patterns/combinations of indicators generated on multiple timeframes. (private repo)

â€¢ Performed analysis of 2020 election data using pandas and matplotlib to determine polling accuracy against the actual results on a state-by-state basis.

â€¢ Built a prediction model of how to price an AirBNB rental based on listings in the area using neural networks to determine what price to set. 

â€¢ Created a site to place a fictional Kickstarter project into, and see if it'll be successfully funded based on NLP & similar projects. 

â€¢ Implement an API that uses OCR libraries to extract legal information from court cases & determine success metrics based on document classification.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I bought a large whiteboard to practice problems on and it's absolutely fantastic for accountability & brainstorming solutions.
