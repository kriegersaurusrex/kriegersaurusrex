### Hey I'm Alex. I recently graduated from Lambda School for data science, and am working on improving some of my projects & expand my knowledge of algorithms to specialize in building prediction models. Am currently seeking a data analytics role in company, with the goal of better understanding your data and how to better leverage this in order to gain better insight & have a strong path forwards for improvement. 

Here's some of my recent projects:
â€¢ Performed analysis of 2020 election data using pandas and matplotlib to determine polling accuracy on a state-by-state basis.
â€¢ Built predictive models aggregated from prior data using sklearn to determine success/failure probability for Kickstarter projects.
â€¢ Implement OCR with pytesseract libraries to extract legal information given to lawyers to make informed decisions regarding cases.
